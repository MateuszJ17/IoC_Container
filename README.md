# Simple IoC container implementation in C# for educational purposes

I've created this very simple app to learn more about DI and IoC and get a deeper understanding of how it works. 

I've been following <a href="https://nearsoft.com/blog/writing-a-minimal-ioc-container-in-c/">this tutorial</a>.

<b>Please note that this implementation is very basic and as such is missing many features that can be found in already existing
DI libraries and should never be used for anything more than learning.</b>
